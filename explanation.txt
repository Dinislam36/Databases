--Explain ANALYZE SELECT * FROM public.customers_1 WHERE age > 20 and age < 60
--Explain ANALYZE SELECT * FROM public.customers_1 WHERE age = 40 or age = 20
--Explain ANALYZE SELECT * FROM public.customers_2 WHERE age > 20 and age < 60
--Explain ANALYZE SELECT * FROM public.customers_2 WHERE age = 40 or age = 20



Explanation: customers_1 have btree, customers_2 have hash, total 1mil rows
We have following timings: 
btree inequality - 315ms
btree equality - 170ms
hash inequality - 370ms
hash equality - 140ms

So, we have more efficency in inequality using btree and more efficency in comparasion using hash
